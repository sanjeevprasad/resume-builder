# Resume builder

I don't use windows so no Microsoft Word. So I created my own resume builder using Svelte and TailwindCSS.
just edit json to quickly create or update your resume.
Live demo => https://sanjeevprasad.net/resume-builder/

Use your browser to create your resume quickly, by just editing JSON. No data is transferred or saved.
If you want to save a copy, it is recommended to save it manually in a json file on your own system.

# Build Step
```sh
#!/bin/sh
# clone and cd to repo
npm install
npm run dev
# now visit 127.0.0.1:4200/resume-builder/
```
