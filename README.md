# Resume builder

I don't use windows so no Microsoft Word. So I created my own resume builder using Svelte and TailwindCSS.
just edit json to quickly create or update your resume.

Just use your browser to create your resume quickly. No data is transferred.
If you want to save a copy, it is recommended to save it manually in a json file on your own system.
